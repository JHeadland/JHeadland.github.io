_UI frameworks_ are the bee's knees. You get a lot of return and reward for taking the time to learn them. Rather than just use raw HTML and CSS, you can use the different aspects of certain UI frameworks to efficiently code out your web pages. Everyone agrees that you should work smarter, not harder. And UI frameworks really promote that. Instead of having to code everything out yourself, there are already predefined functions and vocabulary to simplify web development. For example, with [_Semantic UI_](http://semantic-ui.com/), you can have JavaScript, floated images, and structured layouts and margins easily implemented into your HTML code without having to waste a lot of time coding out and testing particular CSS. This is a great boon to software developers as it improves efficiency and makes web development not only easier to code, but easier to read and understand for group projects.

### Semantic UI and my thoughts on it

I personally really like using Semantic UI. I'm not very creative and I don't like design, so you can imagine my joy when I discovered that I could have most of my CSS and web designing handled for me with just a few keystrokes. CSS is the bane of my programming existence, as I definitely do not enjoy the creative aspect of web development. I vastly prefer programming with logical problem solving and software development, not spending painstaking hours fine tuning the design of a web page. I've never used another framework before, so I don't know how the learning curve of Semantic UI compares to others, but I found it easy to learn and use. After just a few videos, I felt like I could proficiently create any beautiful, well-designed site.
