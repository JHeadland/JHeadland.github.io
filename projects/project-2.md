Hack to the Future was a hacking & Python class I taught to Punahou middle school students during the week between summer school and Fall semester. I developed the curriculum within a span of days for the 9 hour, 5 day course. We began the class with an introduction to Linux and Bash, the latter being important later in the course (for using the tools Aircrack-ng, Reaver, and coding & using a Python brute force dictionary-attack SSH script). We covered the importance of privacy and security, as well as networking through Python and Bash.

My role in teaching this course was as an instructor and curriculum developer alongside [Irene Fang](https://irene-f.github.io/). We both planned the classes and created the content together. I learned a great deal from teaching HTTF. I already knew about the networking concepts we covered from a previous class I taught, Hack My Planet (involving Raspberry Pis and IoT), but I didn't know much about the security concepts or tools. I had to do research to teach it, and as everyone knows, teaching is a great learning experience. Teaching this has definitely prepared me to take ICS 355 Security & Trust I this semester. Going into the class, I already know some of the course content and have interacted with the tools.

Feedback from some of the students:

"GREAT CLASS JON [sic] AND IRENE YOU DA BEST",

"It was fun and challenging",

"you guys r cool"
