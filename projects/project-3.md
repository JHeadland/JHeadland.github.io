Hack to the Future was a hacking & Python class I taught to Punahou middle school students during the week between summer school and Fall semester. I developed the curriculum within a span of days for the 9 hour, 5 day class. We began the class with an introduction to Linux and Bash, the latter being important later in the course (for using the tools Aircrack-ng, Reaver, and coding & using a Python brute force dictionary-attack SSH script). We covered the importance of privacy and security, as well as networking through Python and Bash.
