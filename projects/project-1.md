GeoQuiz is a simple Android app that uses textviews, buttons, toasts, and menus to present a question about geography to the user. The user answers the question by pressing a "True" or "False" button and a toast appears indicating if they were correct or not. They must press another button to view the next question. While this app may seem simple, coding it definitely wasn't. I used the Android Studio IDE with Java and XML to create the app. Android Studio isn't easy to use, and requires intermediate to advanced Java and XML knowledge, as well as knowledge on the Android API and how apps work.

I made this app in preparation for an Android App Development course I taught with Irene Fang at Punahou School. Punahou contracted DevLeague to teach a few classes for their summer school. Our class was designed for high school students, and we used this app as a skeleton for the students to use Android Studio and design their own app for Android.
